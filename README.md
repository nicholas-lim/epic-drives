Embark on a high-octane global adventure in some of the world's coolest, fastest cars.

First up, we will take a ride in the F10 BMW M5. Launched during the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2011, the F10 M5 has a more efficient powerhouse than its predeccessor. Powered by a 4.4L V8 twin-turbo engine and a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, the F10 M5 not only has better fuel economy, it is more powerful at the same time.
